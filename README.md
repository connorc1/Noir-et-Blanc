# Noir-et-Blanc
My very first 3D Unity Game.

This is the final assignment of the unity for my degree. Before this there 
was a number of documents including the GDD. My role within the project was 
the lead programmer. I only did a part of the work within the documents so I
could do more on the actual game.
My contribution within the game prototype was roughly 95% of the code and the 
placing of the walls and floors of the levels according to the design document
which was designed (and the levels) by another team member. The specific audio
triggers and specific game props were placed by team members. However I did do
a good portion of the light placement to specifically work with the shadows
mechanic. (We ran out of time to implement the Animations and some final 
polish, however managed to complete most of the main functionality).

Controls: 
Movement: Up, Down, Left, Right (NOT WSAD)
Pick Up Object(also general interaction): E
Drop Radio: Q
Use Pistol (only one shot from memory): Using the mouse click on one of the 
	lights or guards;
	
Main game mechanic: 
To sneak past the guards use the shadows. The Playable character's avatar
will turn darker when they are in shadows. This indicates they are hidden. 


I shall eventually upload portions of the game documents when I find them.
